# PALM-mbQTL

PALM-mbQTL is an R-based framework (package name: `SAIGEQTL`) for
**fast and scalable Poisson mixed–model microbiome QTL (mbQTL) mapping**.

The method:

- Models microbiome features (taxa, genes, pathways, etc.) as discrete counts.
- Uses a feature-shared random intercept to account for compositional correlation.
- Incorporates a genetic relationship matrix (GRM) to handle related samples.
- Reuses fitted null models to compute genome-wide score statistics efficiently.

## Getting started

1. Read the [Overview](overview.md) to understand the analysis workflow.
2. Install the package and environment: see [Installation](installation.md).
3. Follow the [Quick Start](quickstart.md) guide to run a minimal example.
4. Learn how to prepare your phenotype data:
   - [Step 0 – Merge abundance and covariates](step0_merge_pheno.md)
5. Dive into the core model-fitting steps:
   - [Step 0 – GRM Construction](step0_grm.md)
   - [Step 1 – Null Model Fitting](step1.md)
   - [Step 2 – Genome-wide Score Tests](step2.md)
